This is the README file for the Pedalog PIC code.
Date: 13/10/2011

This code has is based upon Microchip's USB code for the PIC 18F4550.
Changes have been done by: Matt Little, matt@re-innovation.co.uk

Please feel free to use and change this code, but please acknowledge all authors. 

The file structure is as required by Microchip's IDE.
It is written in C and will require the C18 compiler from Microchip (the free un-optimised version will work fine).

To use this code:

Save full file structure to a sensible place.
Open the USB_Pedalog_2010_12_23 file using Microchip MPLAB (free download)
Ensure that the projects build information is correct (things point to the correct files - email if any problems)
Build the project - the output hex file will be in the 'outputs' directory.
Upload this code to the PIC chip using the Microchip bootloader (you must program the IC with this first).

More information on the code and its structure can be found at www.re-innovation.co.uk or email me matt@re-innovation.co.uk.
